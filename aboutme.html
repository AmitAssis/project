<p style="color:black; font-size:24; text-align:center;">
Amit Assis, a 42-year-old live in Rishon LeZion, has a deep love for sports and outdoor activities. <br>

As a devoted fan of Maccabi Tel-Aviv (BaskerBall), he enjoys watching games but is equally passionate about participating in sports himself.<br>
 
Diving, running, hiking, and extreme sports are just a few of the many hobbies that bring him joy and satisfaction. <br>
 
On the family side, I am a dedicated family man, Married to Odelya, We raise three wonderful children together: Idan, Shira, and Yuval.<br>

Professionally, I have accumulated 20 years of experience in the diamond industry.<br>

I initially started as a broker in Israel, then progressed and began traveling to various countries around the world to sell diamonds.<br>

Subsequently, I transitioned into trading on myself, buying and selling diamonds.<br>

However, I recently decided to make a significant change in my life. The diamond industry is in decline,<br>

and I felt the need to seek new challenges. I believes in my abilities and skills, and i am ready to take risks and embark on a new journey.<br>
<br>
<u>The first step in my new path:</u> I recently started a QA course with the goal of entering the field as a junior tester.<br>

I believes that with my extensive experience, analytical skills, and strong desire to learn, I will be able to integrate into the QA field quickly and successfully.<br>

What does the future hold? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure: I have a highly motivated with my determination and enthusiasm,<br>

I will find my way and achieve my new dreams, both in the QA field and in other areas I chooses to pursue.</p>
